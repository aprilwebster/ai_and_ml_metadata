### What is a shapefile?
It's a cluster of files.  All component files have the same filename, but different file extensions.

Three **mandatory** components:
- feature geometry (**.shp**)
- index of the feature geometry (**.shx**)
- feature attribute data (**.dbf**)

Other commonly required files to be able to do analysis:
- projection (**.prj**): coordinate system for the geometric data; essential for accurately integrating more than one shapefile
- metadata (**.xml**): metadata, as used by ArcGIS.
- there are several other files that may be included

#### History of the shapefile
- ESRI 1990s

### What problem was it designed to address?
