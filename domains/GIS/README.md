### Metadata standards in the GIS domain
The Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Spatial Metadata(CSDGM) is a well-known metadata standard 
that has been used in North America and around the world for many years. 

This is the type of metadata created by default with ArcGIS Desktop 9.3.1.
